I’ve written before about [Working with Locales and Time Zones in Rails](articles/working-with-locales-and-time-zones-in-rails/), but I often feel the i18n library (short for internationalisation) is underused (appreciated?). Perhaps it is even avoided because of the perception it is more effort to develop with and harder to maintain. This article will, I hope, open your mind to the idea that you will be better off using i18n in your application (even for a single language) and that it can be maintainable with some simple organisational pointers.
