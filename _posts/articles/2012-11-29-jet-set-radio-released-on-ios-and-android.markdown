Today is a good day, Sega has released [Jet Set Radio](http://www.sega.co.uk/games/jet-set-radio/) on [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/jet-set-radio/id554531935?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sega.jetsetradio).

Jet Set Radio was one of my favourite titles from the Dreamcast era (a console that should and could have done a lot better) amongst so many other titles on the unappreciated console. I'm glad Sega is taking the time to revive some of these classics, particularly one so suited to a touch screen it was almost ahead of its time.

> Jet Set Radio sees you playing as a member of a rebellious gang called The GGs as they fight to gain control of the fictional Tokyo-to whilst dealing with rival gangs and the police. Your character rides using inline skates and is able to jump, grind on rails and skitch on the back of cars. The most common goal in the game is to spray over other gangs' graffiti with your own, which requires the player to collect spraypaint cans littered across the stage. Other missions include showdowns with rival gangs, such as following them along a certain route. At certain times, the police will be called in to chase after the player, often sending troops to slow down the player and firing weapons at them.<cite>Wikipedia</cite>

It was (I think) one of the first games to be fully cell shaded in this way with a manga style (it's a Japanese game after all). The game had already seen a revival on the Xbox Acade but the big deal with the mobile release is the touch screen graffiti control, previously you would follow the on screen indicators with your analog stick to draw the graffiti but with the touch screen you now gesture your "tag" on the screen which works really well.

I've seen a few reviews slating the on screen controls for movement, while they are a bit tricky to get used to a 3rd person rotating environment, it was still tricky with a game pad until you got used to it.

In any case I was very pleased to see this game on the mobile devices as I had always felt it would be well suited, I look forward to seeing what else Sega brings back. [Shenmue](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenmue) perhaps?
