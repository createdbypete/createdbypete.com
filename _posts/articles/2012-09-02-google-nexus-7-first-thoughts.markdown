This isn’t another unboxing post we see so much of on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=unboxing).
I just wanted to share some unbiased (at least I like to think so) first thoughts on my recent purchase of the new [Google Nexus 7](http://www.google.com/nexus/#/7).

#### Why did you buy the Nexus 7?

As a happy iPad owner already why would I want another tablet? The short answer to that is curiosity. Curious about
the price which seems more than reasonable in the current market:
[8GB for £159](https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_8gb) or
[16GB for £199](https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_16gb). If you also take into account their
current promotion of **£15 Google Play credit** (this can be used on anything in the Play store, movies, apps,
books etc.) and full copy of [Transformers: Dark of the Moon](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1399103/) and a handful of
ebooks it’s quite an appealing package Google have put together for the Nexus 7 launch.

#### First impressions

A slightly crumpled jiffy bag sat on my desk, wondering what state the package it contained might be in after being at
the mercy of the couriers van I ripped the top off to reveal a neat black box. I know I said no unboxing but the
packaging is worth mentioning; it’s been nicely done and everything is well protected within.

Once out of the protective wrapper the On button is located on the right-side above the volume
controls. You are greeted by the Google logo and neat Nexus animation until the first-time setup screen appears
allowing you to input you Google account and various other information.

So far so good, the boot up speed was very swift and the first-time setup uncomplicated, with the options explained
clearly enough. The keyboard on this new version of Android (new if you haven’t yet played with Ice Cream Sandwich)
and when holding portrait with hands either side allows for some speedy thumb typing, and accurate thanks to the smart
predictions that even offers apostrophes for those of us trying to maintain some level of grammar.

#### Closer inspection

The 7-inch screen is sharp and the aspect ratio really fits with movies in landscape orientation as it sports a
1280-by-800 pixel resolution it’s certainly not short on pixels and is definitely comparable to the latest Retina
offering from Apple in my opinion.

The sound is good too, for a mobile device at least. I sometimes wish these devices wouldn’t have an external speaker
if only to avoid people using it to play their favourite distorted dubstep tracks as they walk down the street.

One thing I am really appreciating is the rubberised back, I don’t think the aluminium of my iPad has seen the light
of day before it was wrapped in a case to avoid that getting scratched up. The texture also makes holding the device
feel comfortable as there is some friction between your fingers and I’m not concerned about putting it down anywhere
and risk damaging the back.

In the future I would like to see a 3/4G version, this format of device would be ideally suited as it is almost small
enough to carry on you – it fits in my inside coat pocket anyway. However this does throw in the complex issue of
carriers and then expensive plans so perhaps I’ll stick to tethering.

#### I’m giving it all she’s got Captain…

I’m using this quote from [Star Trek’s Scotty (played by James Doohan)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_Scott)
as reference to performance of the Nexus 7, but also because I think these are not a far cry away from the “pads” you
see used in the show.

So far the battery life has really impressed me, I haven’t yet had chance to put it through its paces but having given
it a full over night charge followed by a good 5 hours of use over the past couple of days with Wi-Fi on, it has only
taken ~30% of the power which I think is pretty good.

Battery life is a subjective thing to measure, I tend to be happy if I can get a day of use out of a device and still
have enough juice left to watch a movie on the train home – which as mentioned above it is brilliant for!

Performance has been smooth too, I haven’t downloaded any games to push it yet (although according to the specs they
should be pretty spectacular with a 12-core GPU) but the OS is smooth, animations and transitions are flawless and
everything appears really “snappy” as you’d expect with a top of the line quad-core processor and 1GB RAM at its
disposal the Nexus 7 isn’t breaking a sweat.

#### Google Now

[Google Now](http://www.google.com/landing/now/) is going to be compared and criticised next to Apple’s Siri but I think Google have been quite smart with the format for this “service. Yes you can talk to it, it’s not as chatty as Siri but you can also just type what you want, like you would if you were on your desktop. Not only that but you setup Google Now to remember the “cards” such as the weather, traffic, public transport near to you (this actually work really well, picked up the bus stop outside the office and listed the bus numbers, destinations and arrival time), when the next train will arrive, or your favourite team’s score while they’re playing.

I like the layout and design of the cards too, Google’s latest brand style is great and I believe has made their
service more useable not just more pleasing to look at.

#### Conclusion

Buy with confidence, if you’re already invested in the Google world of Gmail, Maps etc then you will not be
disappointed with Androids integration into your life. The [Nexus 7](http://www.google.com/nexus/#/7) is a hit with me,
smart design, great specs and a decent battery to keep the lights on.

I also like that Android now has a “flagship” tablet that it is so reasonably priced for the quality of product you
get, particularly when compared against the competition. Well done [Asus](http://uk.asus.com/) and
[Google](http://www.google.co.uk/).
